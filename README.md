# Intro-to-Algorithms

I am restarting CLRS as it has been almost an year since I finished it. So, I'll try and solve everything and push it to this repo.

Will also create a separate library repository with all the algorithms and data structures in the future.

P.S. I will be using index starting at 0 so the algorithms might differ somewhat.
